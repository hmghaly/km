The area covered is approximately 1000 kilometres west to east and 650 kilometres north to south.<br>Major regional cities: Gladstone, Mackay and Rockhampton. Major towns : Barcaldine, Biloela, Emerald, Longreach, Proserpine, Sarina and Winton.

Primary production industries include cattle, sheep, grain, fruit, vegetables, cotton and sugar.<br>There is a mixture of both dry land and irrigated farmland. The mining industry draws on rich coal resources from the Bowen Basin. Tertiary industries include tourism (Whitsunday Coast and Island Resorts) and support of education (Central Queensland University has campuses in Mackay, Emerald and Rockhampton), with health care and government offices located in the regional centres.<br>Our Team<br>Rev Scott Ballment is our Presbytery Minister, inducted on 6 November 2020.<br>“I know that God is with us.
